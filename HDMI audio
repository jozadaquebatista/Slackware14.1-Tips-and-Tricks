In a few time ago, I was installed Slackware linux, but with an issue that prevent me to use this awesome distro.
So, I went to Arch Linux and I was using it for a long time, however that starts to get some troubles, and I decided
to turn back and install Slackware 14.1.

In this adventure I came across the same problem, the "HDMI" audio doesn't work still ,then I look up( I don't know if
this expression is right, whatever) to all internet websites and forums, and don't found the right answer, however I
don't give up and still trying to fix it, and luckly I finally fixed! :D

I hope this help all people on Slackware 14.1, to fix problem with HDMI audio.(notice: I don't gonna teach you how to 
install your video card driver correctly, just how to make hdmi sound work).

First of All:

1. Unsure that your Slackware has been installed from zero.

2. After, look up at website of your video card and download the correct driver for it, and after install the 
video card driver correctly.

3. So, go to SlackBuilds.org and download pulseaudio, alsa-utils and pavucontrol and install all this stuff.

4. (...)
