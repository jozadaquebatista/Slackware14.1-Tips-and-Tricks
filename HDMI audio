+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ HOW TO GET HDMI AUDIO WORKING IN SLACKWARE 14.1?

*NOTICE: I look up in many sites and forums so on, and I don't found any tutorial explaining how to do this,
and after 2 days I got it working, and I decided to share the solution(Sorry for my poor english xD, I'm still
improving it).


In a few time ago, I was installed Slackware linux, but with an issue that prevent me to use this awesome distro.
So, I went to Arch Linux and I was using it for a long time, however that starts to get some troubles, and I decided
to turn back and install Slackware 14.1.

In this adventure I came across the same problem, the "HDMI" audio doesn't work still ,then I look up( I don't know if
this expression is right, whatever) to all internet websites and forums, and don't found the right answer, however I
don't give up and still trying to fix it, and luckly I finally fixed! :D

I hope this help all people on Slackware 14.1, to fix problem with HDMI audio.(notice: I don't gonna teach you how to 
install your video card driver correctly, just how to make hdmi sound work).

First of All Unsure your user is not the root, and is included in audio group.

1. Unsure that your Slackware has been installed from zero.

2. After, look up at website of your video card and download the correct driver for it, and after install the 
   video card driver correctly.

3. After that, go to SlackBuilds.org and download pulseaudio, alsa-utils and pavucontrol and install all this stuff.
   notice: Maybe in install of pulse audio, you will get some missing *.new files in /etc/pulse/ directory, to fix this
   copy files in /etc/pulse/ directory and rename to the missing .new files and put there in this same directory again.

4. Go to the terminal and open alsamixer, select your video card with F6, and after press key "M" to unmute all of
   channels.

5.  Now open pavucontrol and select your plugged in, sound output, in my case for example I selected
    "Digital Stereo (HDMI 2) Output" in GK104 HDMI Audio Controller(I don't know if your will look the same), and 
    in "Built-in Audio" I selected "off", to know which of choices are the correct conected, just select the option
    without the tag "(unplugged)".

6. We need now to know which card and device are plugged in, for this type in the terminal:
   $ aplay -l (or aplay -l | grep card)
   This will give you a list of all card and devices in it, in my case I've to look to the card and device with 
   tag [HDMI 2](as I saw before).
   When I type in terminal that returns this result below.
   $ aplay -l | grep card
     card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC892 Analog [ALC892 Analog]
     card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 1: ALC892 Digital [ALC892 Digital]
     card 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]
     card 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 7: HDMI 1 [HDMI 1]
     card 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 8: HDMI 2 [HDMI 2]
     card 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 9: HDMI 3 [HDMI 3]
     
     So I know my HDMI 2 is plugged in, then my correct choice is "card 1" and "device 8", I'll use it later.

7. So, you are almost ready, now you need to configure pulseaudio to look to our correct video card and device(:P), 
   now in your HOME directory create a file named ".asoundrc" and inside of it put the following: 
   
   pcm.pulse {
      type pulse
   }

   ctl.pulse {
      type pulse
   }
   
   Now save and close the archive, and test with this command in terminal: aplay -Dpulse "some_audio_you_want_here.wav"
   If it works, go to next step.
   
8. Now we need to make pulseaudio the default driver, to do this add in the end of .asoundrc archive we created,
   the following content:
   
   pcm.!default {
    type pulse
    # If defaults.namehint.showall is set to off in alsa.conf, then this is
    # necessary to make this pcm show up in the list returned by
    # snd_device_name_hint or aplay -L
    hint.description "Default Audio Device"
   }
   ctl.!default {
    type pulse
   }
   
   save and close, after that all reboot, and you'll get finally the HDMI sound working!!! =D
