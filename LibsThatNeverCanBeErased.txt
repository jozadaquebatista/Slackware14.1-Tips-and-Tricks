+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Libs That Never Can Be Erased



In the last day, I'm on my slackware linux system, and setting my configs, 
when unintentionally I erased the "libc.so.6", that was enough to make the system stop to working.

So that is the tip, don't erase that lib if you don't wanna to see you computer going to EXPLODE, =)




~Thanks.
